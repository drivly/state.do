# [state.do](https://state.do)

Finite State Machine implementation with Durable Objects based on [xstate](https://xstate.js.org).
Use the [editor](https://stately.ai/editor) to create and export your state machine, then optionally add callback fetch URLs/inits to automate the machine events.

## API

Read current state:
```curl
https://state.do/:key
```

Send event to machine:
```curl
https://state.do/:key/:event
```

Initialize machine:
```curl
https://state.do/:key?{"id":"fetch","initial":"init","states":{"init":{"on":{"FETCH":"loading"}},"loading":{"callback":"https://fetcher.do/60sec/https://example.com/","on":{"4XX":"fault","5XX":"failure","*":"success"}},"failure":{"callback":"https://alarms.do/?fromnow=10sec&callback=https://state.do/:key/RETRY","on":{"RETRY":{"target":"loading"}}},"fault":{"callback":"https://example.logging.do/error?message=","type":"final"},"success":{"callback":"https://graphology.do.cf/:key?newnode?example|","type":"final"}}}
```
or POST to `https://state.do/:key`

## Callbacks

Callbacks can be added to the state's `meta` property as a url or as a configuration object with url and init or body:

```json
"State": {
  "meta": {
    "callback": "https://webhooks.do/state",
    "body": {
      "Hello": "world"
    }
  },
  "on": {
    "Event": {
      "target": "State 2"
    }
  }
},
```
More than one callback can be called by passing an array of callbacks.

## Example machine with callbacks

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
[*]-->loading: FETCH
loading-->â¦¿&nbsp;fault: 4XX
loading-->failure: 5XX
loading-->â¦¿&nbsp;success: *
failure-->loading: RETRY
```

```json
{
  "id": "fetch",
  "initial": "init",
  "states": {
    "init": {
      "on": {
        "FETCH": "loading"
      }
    },
    "loading": {
      "callback": "https://fetcher.do/60sec/https://example.com/",
      "on": {
        "4XX": "fault",
        "5XX": "failure",
        "*": "success"
      }
    },
    "failure": {
      "callback": "https://alarms.do/?fromnow=10sec&callback=https://state.do/:key/RETRY",
      "on": {
        "RETRY": {
          "target": "loading"
        }
      }
    },
    "fault": {
      "callback": "https://example.logging.do/error",
      "type": "final"
    },
    "success": {
      "callback": {
        "url": "https://graphology.do.cf/:key?newnode?example",
        "init": {
          "method": "POST"
        }
      },
      "type": "final"
    }
  }
}
```
